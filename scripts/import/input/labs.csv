"Berg, Celeste","http://berglab.gs.washington.edu/tmp/The.html","In the Berg Lab, we use the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate cell communication and cell migration, two processes critical for development and human disease progression. We study the signaling pathways that pattern the follicular epithelium surrounding the oocyte. We also investigate the link between these cell fates and the subsequent cell shape changes and movements that reorganize the flat epithelium into two closed tubes. Patterning and morphogenesis are the fundamental building blocks of all developmental processes."
"Bernard, Phil","http://www.huntsmancancer.org/group/bernard/bernardLab.jsp","Because the clinical behavior of cancer cannot be completely accounted for using morphology alone, it is important to develop molecular techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, and guiding treatment. The Bernard Lab is a “translational” research lab committed to the discovery and clinical implementation of biomarkers for classification, detection, and monitoring of cancer in humans."
"Bredesen, Dale","http://www.buckinstitute.org/TheScience/thebredesen/","The Bredesen laboratory focuses on the biochemical mechanisms that control cell death. Virtually all cells contain a set of internal suicide programs — cell suicide is a vital mechanism for development and maintenance in humans, and the loss of the tight regulation of cell death can result in a wide variety of diseases. Cancer develops when cells fail to commit suicide and continue to grow and survive, but too much cell death can also be harmful, such as occurs with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s."

"Brunet, Anne","http://www.stanford.edu/group/brunet/","Our laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms of aging and longevity. We are particularly interested in the aging of the nervous system. An emerging concept is that organismal aging, long thought to be a byproduct of wear and tear, is actually a highly controlled process, regulated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The search for genes that play a central role in controlling lifespan in several species has converged on components of the signaling pathway that connects insulin/insulin like growth factors to FOXO transcription factors and on the family of Sirtuin deacetylases."

"Goldberg, Alfred","https://agoldberg.med.harvard.edu/","Proteins in the body are constantly being made and then broken down into amino acids. The destruction of the cell's building blocks appears very wasteful at first glance, but it is the cell's version of quality control, which eliminates damaged proteins. Furthermore, the amino acids provide emergency rations for the cell when it is starving. The Goldberg lab is attempting to understand why the cell's machinery destroys only damaged proteins, leaving normal proteins untouched. They are also studing how protein breakdown is important in the body's immune defenses, why the destruction process goes into high gear in certain disease states such as cancer, and how this excessive destruction can be controlled."
"Gottschling, Dan","http://labs.fhcrc.org/gottschling/","Our laboratory uses the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate fundamental questions in biology. One of our current areas of interest is understanding the striking link between increasing age and the incidence of cancer in humans. A hallmark of cancer, genomic instability, is observed in all types of organisms including yeast. We recently discovered that as yeast cells enter the middle-to-late period of their replicative lifespan, they switch to a state of high genomic instability that persists until death.We believe this change represents a fundamental transition in many aging cells and thus are taking a number of approaches to understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon."

"Kapahi, Pankaj","http://www.buckinstitute.org/TheScience/KapahiLab/","The overall focus of the Kapahi laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms of aging. Dietary restriction (DR) is a robust environmental method of lifespan extension in species as diverse as yeast, worms, fruit flies and rodents. Our laboratory was the first to identify the role of target of rapamycin (TOR) in mediating lifespan extension by DR. We propose that changes in mRNA translation downstream of the TOR pathway are key mediators  of its lifespan effects. We are employing an interdisciplinary approach combining biochemical, genetic and genomic techniques, to understand how DR mediates changes in lifespan and metabolism using Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cell culture. Due to its robustness and strong conservation across species, identifying the molecular mechanisms that modulate lifespan upon DR holds great promise to find potential targets for enhancing healthspan in humans. Our work also has the broader significance to help uncover the role of nutrition and identify therapeutics for age-related human diseases like cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration."

"Lombard, David","http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu/faculty/Lombard/index.html","Aging is a conserved but poorly understood biological phenomenon. In lower organisms, overexpression or hyperactivity of sirtuins – homologs of the yeast Sir2 deacetylase – confer extended lifespan. Mammals possess seven sirtuins, called SIRT1-SIRT7. Many of these proteins modulate metabolic processes; their potential roles in regulating aging in mammals are uncharacterized. We previously showed that SIRT3 is a mitochondrial factor that deacetylates numerous protein targets in this organelle; we are currently elucidating the biological significance of this activity. More recently we have found that calorie restriction (CR), an intervention that extends lifespan in many organisms, is also associated with perturbations in mitochondrial acetylation. Using a mass spectrometry-based approach, we have identified many factors with altered acetylation during CR as well as numerous novel SIRT3 substrates. We are currently working to uncover how acetylation affects activities of individual factors as well as overall mitochondrial function during CR."

"Paigen, Beverely","http://research.jax.org/faculty/beverly_paigen.html","Most common human diseases are complex, caused by many genes that interact with environmental risk factors. For examples, the genes that cause heart disease interact with a person's diet and exercise regimen, and the genes that cause high blood pressure interact with a person's salt intake and stress level. We use mouse models to study these diseases because mice are genetically well defined, relatively inexpensive to work with, reproduce quickly, are biologically very similar to humans, and their environments can be strictly regulated. Understanding the genetics of quantitative traits in mice helps us understand them in humans. In our laboratory, we are focusing on finding genes that control HDL-cholesterol levels, one of the many traits underlying heart disease risk. If we can identify some of these genes, we will gain insight into gene networks and systems biology. Additionally, we are applying similar techniques to studies of lung disease and the genetics of aging and longevity."
"Palmer, Ruth","http://soul.ucmp.umu.se/ruth/","In humans, one third of non-Hodgkins lymphomas involve a 2;5 chromosomal translocation. In this translocation the catalytic domain of the orphan RTK ALK is fused to a nuclear phosphoprotein: NPM (nucleophosmin) producing a NPM-ALK/p80 protein with constituative PTK activity (see Figure on left).

Transgenic mice that overexpress catalase and other antioxidant enzymes have enhanced longevity and are being examined to provide insights in this model system. Studies of neoplastic progression focus on precancerous human gastrointestinal diseases and the hope that a better understanding of these disease processes will yield improved management of individual patients and their cancer risk.

Our lab is now using functional genomic and genetic strategies to systematically discover the components of the RNAi and microRNA pathways in C. elegans.
